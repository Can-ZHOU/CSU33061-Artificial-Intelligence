## Week one <a name="week_01"></a>
### Lecture one <a name="lec_01"></a>
- #### Can machines think? 
    - Turing test: cheating
    - ELIZA: 
        - use pattern matching and substitution to fake understanding
        - ELIZA effect: humans are inclined to see computers as humans
        - `**AI-complete**`: An AI problem is AI-complete if any AI problem is mechanically reducible to it
    - Chinese room argument -- week AI
        - mindless obedience **is not** mind from bioloical processes.
- #### Agent & environment

    - learning (from environment): trial & error -> data as oil
    - moving target: changing agent & environment
- #### Levels of intelligence
    - Autonomous = perform tasks in complex environments without constant user guidance.
    - Adaptive = improve performance by learning from experience.
    - From low-level intelligence to high-level intelligence:  
    Reflex -> States -> Variables -> Logic
### Lecture two
- #### Logical limitation:
    - truth
    - sets/membership
    - countability
    - change
    - computability

proof that computers cannot do everything the halting problem
